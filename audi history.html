    <h2>The Beginnings of Audi</h2>
    <p>
      Audi was founded by August Horch in 1909. The company’s name comes from the Latin translation of Horch’s surname, which means "listen." 
      In 1932, four companies—Audi, DKW, Horch, and Wanderer—merged to form Auto Union AG. This merger is symbolized by the iconic four rings logo 
      that represents the heritage of these brands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known for technological innovation and exceptional craftsmanship, Audi introduced front-wheel drive vehicles as early as the 1930s, 
      setting a trend in automotive design. During the 1980s, Audi revolutionized rally racing with the Audi Quattro, a groundbreaking 
      all-wheel-drive system.

    <h2>About the Founders</h2>
    <p>
      August Horch, a German engineer and automobile pioneer, established Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke in 1899. However, due to differences 
      with the company's board, he left and founded his new company in 1909. Unable to use the "Horch" brand name legally, 
      he named the new company "Audi," using the Latin word for "listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1932, the merger of Audi, DKW, Horch, and Wanderer marked the beginning of the Auto Union era, setting the stage for one of the 
      most recognized car manufacturers today.
